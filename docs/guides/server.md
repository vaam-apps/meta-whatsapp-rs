# Run the service: meta-whatsapp-server

Apps not written in Rust (a Medusa store in TypeScript, a CMS backend in
any stack) use meta-whatsapp-rs through **meta-whatsapp-server**, an HTTP
service built on the library. This guide runs it, configures it, creates
tenants and keys, and makes a first authenticated call. The design, with
its reasons and the owner's decisions, is
[docs/design/server.md](../design/server.md); the rules it keeps are in
[architecture.md](../architecture.md#service-meta-whatsapp-server).

> **What exists today (milestone M1a).** Tenants, API keys, the admin API,
> attaching the platform's own WhatsApp Business Accounts (WABAs), the
> numbers and business profile routes, vault key rotation, health, metrics
> and the OpenAPI document. **Not yet**: sending messages, media and
> templates (M1b), receiving Meta's webhooks (M1c: `POST /webhooks/meta`
> answers `405`), the inbox and live events (M2), Embedded Signup and OTP
> (M3), the Docker image and the TypeScript client (M4).
> [coverage.md](../coverage.md) tracks it.
>
> **Do not point a Meta app's callback URL at an M1a deployment**: Meta's
> subscription check passes, but every delivery is refused (`405`) and
> Meta retries each for up to seven days.

## The shape of it

One deployment serves one Meta app, for many tenants (your merchants, or
your store). It has two listeners:

| Listener | Default bind | Serves | Who reaches it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| public | `127.0.0.1:8080` | `GET /webhooks/meta` (Meta's subscription check), `GET /livez` | Meta, through your HTTPS ingress |
| internal | `127.0.0.1:8081` | the `/v1` API, `/v1/admin`, `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/v1/openapi.json`, `/v1/version` | your backends and operators, on the private network only |

Both default to loopback; in a container, set them to `0.0.0.0:…`
explicitly and keep the internal one off the internet (a network policy
admitting your backends). The service answers no CORS request: browsers
never call it, your backend does.

## Build and run

There is no image yet (M4). Build the binary from this repository:

```bash
cargo build --release -p meta-whatsapp-server
./target/release/meta-whatsapp-server --help
```

The commands:

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `meta-whatsapp-server serve` | validates the configuration, migrates (unless `WA_SERVER_MIGRATE=skip`), serves both listeners until `SIGTERM` |
| `meta-whatsapp-server migrate` | creates or upgrades the tables, then exits (for a one-off job) |
| `meta-whatsapp-server openapi` | prints the OpenAPI 3.1 document |
| `meta-whatsapp-server healthcheck` | exits 0 when the internal listener's `/livez` answers 200 |
| `meta-whatsapp-server admin create-admin-key [--expires-at …]` | mints an admin key and prints it once |
| `meta-whatsapp-server admin create-platform-key --tenants '*' --scopes numbers [--expires-at …]` | mints a platform key and prints it once |
| `meta-whatsapp-server admin list-keys [--tenant <id>]` | lists the admin and platform keys (or a tenant's), never a secret |
| `meta-whatsapp-server admin revoke-key <key_id>` | revokes a key of any kind |
| `meta-whatsapp-server vault rotate` | re-encrypts every WABA's token under the active vault key (as `POST /v1/admin/vault/rotate`) |

## Configure

Everything comes from the environment. Every secret may instead come from
a file: set `<NAME>_FILE` to its path (not both; one trailing newline is
dropped). `WA_SERVER_CONFIG`, the design's TOML file of non-secrets, is not
read yet: set, it stops the start.

| Variable | Default | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | required outside development | Postgres (a secret: it holds a password) |
| `WA_SERVER_ENV` | `production` | `development` allows memory storage and a throwaway vault key |
| `WA_SERVER_PUBLIC_BIND`, `WA_SERVER_INTERNAL_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:8080`, `127.0.0.1:8081` | must differ |
| `WA_APP_SECRET` | required | the Meta app's secret (`WA_APP_SECRET_PREVIOUS` too while rotating) |
| `WA_VERIFY_TOKEN` | required | the token you enter in the App Dashboard for the webhook |
| `WA_APP_ID`, `WA_ES_CONFIG_ID` | — | read now, used from M3 (Embedded Signup) |
| `WA_VAULT_KEY` | required with Postgres | base64 of 32 random bytes (`openssl rand -base64 32`): encrypts the business tokens |
| `WA_VAULT_KEY_ID` | `k1` | the key's id, recorded with each token |
| `WA_VAULT_PREVIOUS_KEYS` | — | older keys still read, `<id>:<base64>` comma-separated; every id once, the active one's included |
| `WA_OTP_PEPPER` | required with Postgres | at least 32 bytes, kept out of the database (OTP arrives in M3) |
| `WA_ONBOARDING_MODE` | `tech_provider` | `solution_partner` also needs `WA_PARTNER_SYSTEM_TOKEN`, `WA_PARTNER_SYSTEM_USER_ID`, `WA_CREDIT_LINE_ID`, `WA_WABA_CURRENCY` (AUD, EUR, GBP, IDR, INR or USD) |
| `WA_GRAPH_API_VERSION`, `WA_GRAPH_ENDPOINT` | `v25.0`, Graph | a proxy or a test stub: every token travels to it, so `https` outside development, and `serve` warns with its host |
| `WA_SERVER_MIGRATE` | `auto` | `skip` when a job runs `meta-whatsapp-server migrate` |
| `WA_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE` | `25s` | how long open requests get after `SIGTERM` |
| `WA_SERVER_LOG_FORMAT`, `RUST_LOG` | `json`, `info` | `text` for humans |

**The service refuses to start** rather than run unsafely: on a missing
or blank app secret or verify token, a missing vault key or a pepper
under 32 bytes with Postgres, memory storage outside
`WA_SERVER_ENV=development`, identical binds, Solution Partner mode
without its four settings, a plain-`http` Graph endpoint outside
development, a vault key id used twice, a value it cannot parse, or a
variable set both directly and as a file. The message names the
variable, never its value.

A minimal production start:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://wa:…@db.internal:5432/wa
export WA_APP_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/wa_app_secret
export WA_VERIFY_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/wa_verify_token
export WA_VAULT_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/wa_vault_key
export WA_OTP_PEPPER_FILE=/run/secrets/wa_otp_pepper
export WA_SERVER_PUBLIC_BIND=0.0.0.0:8080 WA_SERVER_INTERNAL_BIND=0.0.0.0:8081
meta-whatsapp-server serve
```

For a local try without Postgres, `WA_SERVER_ENV=development` runs on
memory with a throwaway vault key; everything is lost on restart. The
admin CLI talks to the database and cannot reach it, so `serve` writes a
one-time admin key for that process to standard error at start (never
to the logs). For a local Postgres, `docker compose -f compose.test.yaml
up -d --wait` starts one on port 55432 (`postgres://wa:wa@127.0.0.1:55432/wa`).

### Storage and migrations

Postgres holds everything: the library's tables (`wa_kv`, the inbox's
`wa_messages` and `wa_conversations`) and the service's (`wa_server_tenants`,
`wa_server_api_keys`, `wa_server_wabas`, `wa_server_numbers`), each with
its own migration history. `serve` and `migrate` run both under an
advisory lock, so replicas starting together never interleave them.
Service migrations only ever add (expand, then contract in a later
release), so replicas of two versions can share the database during a
rolling deploy. Back up the database and, separately, the vault key: a
backup without the key cannot decrypt a single token.

## Tenants and keys

A tenant is one of your merchants (or your own store). Its id is yours
(the CMS merchant id, say): 1 to 64 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]`,
immutable. Three kinds of API key, all `wak_<key id>_<secret>`, sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <key>`:

| Key | Acts as | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenant key | its tenant | a backend that is one tenant (the store) |
| platform key | the tenant named in the `WA-Tenant` header, if among its allowed tenants (`*` or a list) | the CMS backend, acting for each merchant |
| admin key | nobody: `/v1/admin` only | operators |

Tenant and platform keys carry scopes (`numbers` today; `send`, `media`,
`templates`, `inbox`, `events`, `webhooks`, `signup`, `otp` for the routes
to come). The service keeps only each key's id and the SHA-256 of its
secret, and shows the key once. Rotate by minting a new one, deploying
it, then revoking the old one: revocation and suspension take effect on
the next request, on every replica.

**1. The first admin key** comes from the CLI, never from the
environment:

```bash
ADMIN_KEY=$(DATABASE_URL=… meta-whatsapp-server admin create-admin-key --name ops)
```

**2. A tenant and its key**, through the admin API:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/admin/tenants \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "merchant-42", "name": "Lucky Shrub"}'
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/admin/tenants/merchant-42/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scopes": ["numbers"], "name": "medusa"}'
```

The second answer is `{"key": "wak_…", "api_key": {…}}`: store `key` in
your backend's secret manager now; it is not shown again. A platform key
for the CMS is `POST /v1/admin/platform-keys` with
`{"tenants": "*", "scopes": ["numbers"]}` (or a list of tenant ids).

**3. A WABA for the tenant.** Merchants will connect their own numbers
with Embedded Signup (M3). The platform's own WABA is attached by an
operator with a system user token that can reach it; the service asks
Meta for the WABA's numbers with that token, binds exactly those to the
tenant, stores the token encrypted and subscribes the app to the WABA's
webhooks. Keep the token out of your shell history and the process list:
pass the body from a file.

```bash
# attach.json: {"waba_id": "102290129340398", "token": "EAAG…"} (then delete it)
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/admin/tenants/merchant-42/wabas \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @attach.json
```

A token Meta rejects is `422 invalid_request` on `token`. If Meta refuses
the subscription, the WABA stays attached and the call answers Meta's
error: repeat it once fixed. A WABA bound to one tenant is refused to
another (`409 waba_owned_by_another_tenant`, decision D4, also for one of
its numbers); `GET /v1/admin/wabas/{waba_id}` says who holds it, and
`DELETE /v1/admin/wabas/{waba_id}/binding` frees it: the service
unsubscribes the app with the stored token if it still works (Meta
refusing does not stop it), then deletes the token and the bindings. That
is also the way to free a WABA whose token no longer works: its tenant
cannot disconnect it. Suspend a tenant with `PATCH
/v1/admin/tenants/{id}` and `{"status": "suspended"}`; delete it with
`DELETE /v1/admin/tenants/{id}`, which first disconnects each of its
WABAs from Meta and stops at the first that fails (`409` for one without
a usable token: unbind it first). A tenant id already taken is `409
tenant_exists`.

**4. Rotating the vault key.** Put the new key in `WA_VAULT_KEY` (with a
new `WA_VAULT_KEY_ID`) and the old one in `WA_VAULT_PREVIOUS_KEYS`,
deploy, then call `POST /v1/admin/vault/rotate` (or run
`meta-whatsapp-server vault rotate`): it re-encrypts every bound WABA's
token under the new key and answers `{wabas, rotated, failed}`. Drop the
old key once `failed` is empty.

## A first call

With the tenant key (or the platform key and `WA-Tenant: merchant-42`):

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/numbers -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/numbers/106540352242922 -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

The first lists the tenant's numbers and their connection status from the
service's own records; the second asks Meta for the number's display
number, verified name, quality rating, name status and throughput, with
the WABA's token. Every call checks, in this order: the key (`401`), the
tenant (`403`), the scope (`403`), that the tenant owns the number or WABA
in the path (`404` otherwise, exactly as for a number that does not
exist), and only then reads the token. `GET`/`PATCH
/v1/numbers/{pn}/profile` reads and changes the business profile, and
`DELETE /v1/wabas/{waba_id}` disconnects a WABA: the service unsubscribes
the app with the WABA's token, and deletes the token and bindings only if
Meta agreed.

The whole contract is the OpenAPI document: `GET /v1/openapi.json`, or
[crates/meta-whatsapp-server/openapi/v1.json](../../crates/meta-whatsapp-server/openapi/v1.json)
in the repository. Generate TypeScript types from it with
`npx openapi-typescript`.

## Errors

Every error answers one body:

```json
{"error": {"code": "reconnect_required",
  "message": "The number's token is no longer valid: connect it again.",
  "retryable": false, "may_have_been_sent": false, "field": null,
  "step": null, "resumable": null,
  "graph": {"code": 190, "subcode": 463, "fbtrace_id": "AXsgnV2Cm3ZMGF3dF_cfYIn", "details": null},
  "request_id": "req_4f1c2a9b0d3e5f67"}}
```

- Branch on `code`, never on `message` (the service's sentence) or on the
  status alone. Codes only grow within `v1`; treat one you do not know by
  its status class. A failure Meta reported carries Meta's error kind as
  its code (`template_not_found`, `marketing_opted_out`, …; the list is
  the `ErrorCode` schema of the OpenAPI document) and Meta's code under
  `graph`; Meta's own error message never reaches you. `graph.details` is
  Meta's text, not the service's (at most 512 characters, without control
  characters): show it to an operator, never branch on it.
- A path called with a method it does not take is `405
  method_not_allowed`, with `Allow`.
- **Resend only when `may_have_been_sent` is `false`.** A `504 timeout`
  or a `502` may have taken effect at Meta.
- `invalid_request` names the offending `field`; `401` is always
  `unauthenticated`; a number of another tenant is `404 not_found`.
- A token Meta rejects (`190`) marks the WABA's numbers
  `reconnect_required`: later calls answer `409 reconnect_required`
  without asking Meta, until the WABA is attached (or onboarded) again.

## Operations

- `/livez` answers while the process runs; `/readyz` fails when Postgres
  does not answer or after `SIGTERM` (the listeners stop accepting at the
  same moment: keep a preStop delay in Kubernetes if the load balancer
  must see the replica unready first).
- Limits, per listener: a request head must arrive within 10 s (slow
  clients are cut off), 1,024 connections on the public listener and
  4,096 on the internal one (more wait), and every request is answered
  within 55 s (past it, `504 timeout` with `may_have_been_sent: true`).
- `/metrics` (Prometheus) counts requests by listener, method, route
  template, status and error code, their duration, and failed Graph calls
  by code; never an id, a number or a key.
- Logs are JSON, one line per request with its id (`X-Request-Id`, echoed
  or generated), route template (never the raw path), tenant, the public
  id of the key that made it, status and duration; every change an
  operator makes is also an `audit` event (action, admin key id, the
  tenant, key or WABA touched). No secret, token, message text or phone
  number is logged; Meta's error texts only at `debug`.
- Known limit: key digests are unpeppered SHA-256 of random 256-bit
  secrets. Nobody can reverse one, but whoever can write the database's
  keys table can plant a key: guard write access to it.
- `SIGTERM` fails `/readyz`, stops both listeners from accepting and gives
  open requests `WA_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE`.
